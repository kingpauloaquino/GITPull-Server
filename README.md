# GITPull-Server

Due to always manual git pull on the server and the hassle of logging in on SSH or Remote Desktop.

I created a program to be able for my team and me to pull the git on the server without access to ssh or remote desktop

## Config

Use config.json to change the IP Address and Port number. Recommended not to change the IP Address. Only the port number

## Notes

Be sure you allow the ./gitserver to your privacy policy if you are a mac m1 user (Full Disk Access)
